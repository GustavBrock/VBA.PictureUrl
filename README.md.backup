### Display pictures directly from an URL

Traditionally, the method to display pictures in Access forms and reports is first to download them from URLs to a folder, record the path in a table, and then let the form or report pull the pictures from that folder.

But why not let Windows retrieve the pictures automatically from the URLs? 
Pictures can even be cached automatically, speeding up browsing and printing of downloaded pictures.

Further, with a helper function, the SQL of the report or form can be adjusted to do all the work, meaning that zero code needs to be added to the form or report.

### Code
Code has been tested with both 32-bit and 64-bit *Microsoft Access 365*.
